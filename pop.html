    The increase in searches for Shetland Ponies at the beginning of 2013 is as it was the Year of Natural Scotland. This resulted in many of this species wearing wooly cardigans. A picture of the following can be seen in the Shetland Pony section above.
    <br>
    The very noticable spike in searches for Shetland Ponies in March of the same year is almost certainly as a result of the release of this advert:

    <h3>
         At the time of writing, it has nearly 13 million views.

  <br>
  <h3>
    A small increase occured on the 14th of July 2013, when Countryfile did an episode on the Shetland Islands, whilst the rise in the number of searches in December 2015 is due to the unveiling of a festive 'foursie', designed by Ascot Racecourse for Daffy the Shetland Pony. The increase in early February 2016 took place when Gemma Collins, a television personality, recieved a Shetland Pony for her birthday on Celebrity Big Brother.
    <br>
    <br>
    On the 23rd of April 2016, Amazon released their advert, A Lonely Little Horse:

    <br>
    <br>
    Though, as seen on the chart, It was not as big a success as the Three advert.
    <br>
    <br>
    Another popular Shetland Pony is Little Alf, who is five years old and has Dwarfism (restricted growth), standing at only 71.12 cm tall. He however currently has 5 books published about him, and his very own clothing and gift range. He's also a model, a social media style, and met Princess Anne for services to the Riding for the Disabled Association charity.
    <br>
    <br>
    Though Shetland Ponies have certainly seen their slice of fame, the number of Connemara, Highland, and Dartmoor Pony lookups, on the other hand, stay relatively low throughout the past five years.
    <br>
    <br>
    The peak number of searches for Dartmoor Ponies occured in September 2014, when, as The Telegraph put it,</h3>
    <blockquote cite="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/11119194/Eat-ponies-to-save-them-says-charity.html">"A pony charity...controversially endorsed eating them [Dartmoor Ponies] in a bid to save the species...by creating a "sustainable market" for them".
    </blockquote>
    <h3>
    Princess Anne claimed horse owners may take better care of their animals when they are alive if they believed they could later sell them for meat.
    <br>
    <br>
Highland Pony lookups reached their peaks in late May 2013 (probably due to a BBC Radio 4 episode on them), and late March 2014
    <br>
    <br>
    Connemara Pony searches were at their highest in August 2013.
